A/C Controller Operational Notes
==============================================================================


These are notes taken about the operations of the A/C controller field 
testing.

8/20/2014: @20:27 thermostat changed from hold 76 to hold 77 since it was
           feeling chilly, especially at night in bedroom.

8/21/2014: @12:30 thermostat set back to hold 76 since Clara was feeling
           hot. Maybe the thermostat needs to work on a program to hold
           a different daytime temperature than the nighttime temp.

8/23/2014: @03:00 Minimum AC ON time reduced from 30min to 20min and minimum
           time between AC OFF to AC ON increased from 20min to 30min. This
           was done because mid-day run subtotals were exceeding the tstat's
           subtotals for cooling. 

8/24/2014: Data lost between 15:00 to 19:00 due to file system corruption
           on RPi collection machine.

8/26/2014: Data lost between 10:00 and 13:30 due to recurring problem with
           RPi file system. New SD card put into service on RPi. 

8/27/2014: @17:00 Minimum AC ON time increased from 20min to 30min. This was
           done because it has felt a little warmer and the humidity is 
           higher since the minimum run time was lowered to 20min.
