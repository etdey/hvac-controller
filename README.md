# Residential HVAC controller

This is the firmware source code for my residential HVAC controller
circuit. You will need the [Microchip](http://www.microchip.com/) MPLAB X IDE
in order to compile it and the PICKit programmer to upload it to a PIC
microcontroller. 

See my [project web site](http://ericdey.com/projects/hvac-controller/) for the
full details on the circuit.
